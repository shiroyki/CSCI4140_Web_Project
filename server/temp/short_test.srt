00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,640
Last year the smoking tire went on the Bull Run live rally in the 2010 Ford SVT Raptor.

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:08,880
I liked it so much, I bought one, and here it is.

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,760
We're going back to Bull Run this year, of course, to help from our friends at Black Magic,

4
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:17,760
and we're so serious about it, we got two Valentine 1 radar detectors.

5
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,260
Oh yeah.

6
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:25,160
So we're all set up, and the reason we got two is because we're going to be going a little bit faster.

7
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:31,920
We got a 2011 Shelby GT500 with a 550 horsepower all aluminum V8.

8
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,320
We are going to be right in the action bringing you guys a video every single day,

9
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,720
live from the Bull Run rally, July 9th to 16th.

10
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:45,560
And the only place to watch it is on BlackMagicshine.com, or right here on the Smoking Tire.
